# Food for now

### Summary
As busy professionals, there will be times where we need inspiration to help decide what to cook for dinner. Sometimes this is dictated by what we have on hand or something that we are craving.
The vision of this app is to maximize the food that we have and available or find new things to make with something we are craving. This app also will help us be more aware of what we are buying at the store for a specific purpose, to help us reduce waste by letting user input ingredients that are available at home now at that moment by giving simple recipes that they can make from those ingredients.

### Scope In
- Search for recipes based on ingredients typed into search.
- Return recipies with ingrediet information, instructions, and other pertinent information.

### Scope Out
It will not search for restaurants....yet.
Will not solve WORLD HUNGER. NOT YET.

## Stretch Goals:
- User Profile : Login-Logout / multiple users
- CSS transitions animations and sugar
- Integrating filters and sorts 
- Adding another API
- Voice search
- In recipes, ingredients that is searched are bolded for better UX

## Flow:
1. Go to homepage.
2. There will be an input box where user can put ingredients. (i.e. eggs and potatoes)
3. Then the website will return list of 10 recipes that contains those ingredients.
4. User can click to a recipe to view more details of the selected recipe.
5. Then, user can save the recipe to database.
6. Then user can access the saved recipes and update/edit/delete.

## NON-FUNCTIONALITY
- Sanitation of data to prevent unexpected database manipulation.
- Limiting amount of results from API to avoid overloading the page.
